## Description
We built this project as our submission for [HackRPI 2019](https://hackrpi-2019.devpost.com/). This application is a solution to a problem regarding accessibility to education; specifically, we want to enable prospective college students to experience the colleges that they are considering, before they commit to attending it.  Our answer is to enable college students themselves to upload photos & videos of their experiences, in order to provide a transparent view (hence the name GlassCollege) of the college, as instituionally-sponsored may be subject to biases.
